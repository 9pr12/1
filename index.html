                Dear Khadija,<br>
                I want to take a moment to express how incredibly special you are to me. 
                You have been a shining light in my life, illuminating my path even during the darkest times. 
                Although we've parted ways, please know that you remain in my heart and thoughts every single day. 
                I often find myself reflecting on the beautiful moments we shared, and it brings both a smile and a sense of longing. 
                I regret not being able to express my feelings better at times, and for that, I am truly sorry. 
                I feel crazy for leaving; it was never easy, and it weighed heavily on my heart. 
                You are always on my mind, and my love for you runs deep. 
                Thank you for every moment, every smile, and every memory. 
                You are an amazing person, and I wish you nothing but happiness and love in your life. 
                Always remember, you are cherished beyond words.
            </p>
